FreeCodeCamp: Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Personal Portfolio Site

This is the fifth of the Responsive Web Design Projects in Free Code Camp. The objective was to build a personal portfolio website that meets Free Code Camp's user stories requirements.


I used HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 4.
